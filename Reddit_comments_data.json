If Trump was popular and the economy wasn\u2019t crashing, Republicans could maybe weather the Epstein storm.. but I see them actually using Epstein as an off-ramp to turn on Trump and impeach him themselves. The election this week showed House Republicans especially that none of them will be re-elected next year if they stay on the sinking ship.\nI\u2019m convinced this is why Marjorie Green has gone rogue.

    "comment": "Part 1:\nRumors about Donald Trump\u2019s connection to Jeffrey Epstein have gripped the Republican Party.\nA few conservative representatives with ties to the FBI and the Justice Department have spilled that the true details of the Epstein files are \u201cworse\u201d for Trump than previously reported, according to journalist David Schuster.\nMichael Wolff, a longtime chronicler of Trump\u2019s White House who conducted extensive interviews with Epstein prior to his death, toldThe Daily Beastlast month that Epstein had shown him photos of Trump with half-naked \u201cyoung girls\u201d in his lap.\nThese rumors have galvanized into a legitimate movement amongst Republicans, who are now, Schuster wrote on X Wednesday night, clamoring for the files\u2019 full release.\nFor months, just four Republicans had penned their signatures on a discharge petition demanding transparency into the investigation of the pedophilic sex trafficker and his potential associates. Those conservative lawmakers include Representatives Thomas Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Nancy Mace, and Lauren Boebert.\nRepresentative-elect Adelita Grijalva, who won the special election in Arizona in September, has also vowed to sign the bipartisan petition. She\u2019s the last signature that the House needs to force a vote on the issue\u2014and Speaker Mike Johnson has conveniently refused to swear her in for more than a month.\nBut the disturbing new rumor has drudged up far more support, with \u201cmore than 100 Republicans\u201d planning to vote alongside Democrats in an effort to \u201cget in front of what\u2019s coming,\u201d reported Schuster.",

The typically bombastic Attorney General Pam Bondi was silent when asked about the photos during a Senate hearing last month, a choice that further \u201cspooked\u201d several GOP lawmakers, with many interpreting her non-response as a very vocal \u201cyes.\u201d\n\u201cThe question is, did the FBI find those photographs that have been discussed publicly by a witness who claimed that Jeffrey Epstein showed them to him?\u201d asked Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse in early October.\nBut Bondi could only blink with her mouth agape.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about that?\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cOkay.\u201d",

He walked in on the girls at his TEEN beauty pageant and he ran a modeling agency. He was Epstein\u2019s BEST FRIEND and people really thought he wasn\u2019t involved from top to bottom?\nI know that the core of his cult will ignore anything negative about him, I didn\u2019t expect them to put these pieces together. But for people who don\u2019t support him to be treating this like breaking news is just shocking to me. Like, fucking obviously he was a trafficker. He was literally on Epstein\u2019s \u201cpussy committee\u201d that was tasked with finding girls for Andrew. We ALREADY KNEW THIS.",

Its a non answer as he's not offering an opinion in support or against Trump. Just that as POTUS he does have the power to change the world which he has done negatively imo.\nThe same article later states Erdogan against Ronaldo likely due to his pro Palestinian stance.\nLmao reddit just being used as a comment reading factory rather than paying any attention to the content of the headline.",

They ran a sex trafficking ring together and blackmailed people together and that man thought Trump was a deplorable human being. \ud83e\udd2f\nThat's a demon that's not even a human \ud83d\udc79",
